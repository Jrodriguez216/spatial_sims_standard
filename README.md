# Standardizing spatial simulations on SLiM
We demonstrate several spatial simulation scripts that can (hopefully) be modified easily by users for their ecological scenarios in mind.

List of examples:
- selection
- maps
- adult movement
- mate choice
- case studies

In the main directory, we have a minimal example of hermaphrodites on a blank map.
Here is what each code block does:
## Setting up parameters

   
## Initialize interactions (include sex, etc)
## tick 1 first - putting in map
## reproduction (includes dispersal)

## competition (density control)
## output

Other subdirectories will have their own readme.
